## Third-Party APIs Challenge: Work Day Scheduler (Module 5)
The purpose of this challenge was to create a scheduler that would save user information into local storage.

## Installation:
In order to access the files needed to complete the challenge see: https://github.com/BrennanJLM/work-day-scheduler and clone either the following HTTPS link or SSH key:
HTTPS Link: https://github.com/BrennanJLM/work-day-scheduler.git
SSH Key: git@github.com:BrennanJLM/password-generator.git
In order to clone the project to a "projects" directory, open your terminal (mac) or gitbash (windows) window and type the following commands into your terminal/gitbash command line:
1 - mkdir projects
2 - cd ./projects (You can use the command "pwd" to ensure you are in the correct directory)
3 - git clone <HTTPS link> OR git clone <SSH Key>
4 - ls (this will list all of the files now inside of the current directory)
Open your coding software, select "open file" and locate the module-3-challenge file in your projects directory OR find the correct file in your directory and "Open With" your coding software.

## Usage
- This website's main purpose is to serve as a scheduler for users to use to keep their day organized. The user will:
- Be presented the current day at the top of the scheduler
- The user has the ability to assign tasks to specific time blocks
- The blocks are color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
- The user can then save the information stored in the text field
- The saved information pesists in local storage
